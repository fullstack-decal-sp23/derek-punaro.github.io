                <p> Completing an internship in the health industry can be a valuable experience for students interested in pursuing a career in healthcare.
                    Derek Punaro, a student who attended UC Berkeley, had the opportunity to complete such an internship at CareXc, a company that specializes
                    in providing digital health solutions. During his internship, Derek completed a full static website and then turned that static website into
                    a dynamic website using applications such as Docker, Git, and React. This experience allowed Derek to gain hands-on experience in web development and deployment, as well as learn about the latest technologies and practices used in the industry. By working alongside industry professionals in a fast-paced and dynamic environment, Derek gained valuable skills and knowledge that will help him succeed in a career in healthcare technology.</p>

                <p>I performed some data analysis on the conservation statuses of endangered species and investigated if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.</p>
